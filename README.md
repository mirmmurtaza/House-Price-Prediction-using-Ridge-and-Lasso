# House Price Prediction using Ridge and Lasso

This project aimed to help the US-based housing company Surprise Housing enter the Australian market by building a regression model using regularization to predict the actual value of prospective properties. I identified significant variables in predicting the price of a house and determined the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression. The goal was to help the company understand how the prices of houses vary with the available independent variables and to manipulate their strategy to yield high returns. Additionally, the model developed helped the company understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

To prepare the data, I handled missing values using median and mode for numerical and categorical columns, respectively, detected and removed outliers, converted categorical data into a suitable numeric representation, and scaled the features.

For model development, I utilized applied both ridge and lasso regularization techniques and performed hyper-parameter tuning to achieve an R2 score of 89.26% and 89.51% on the test data, respectively. I also computed the most important features for making predictions using coefficients. The model built provided the company with insights into which variables are significant in predicting house prices and how well they describe the price of a house, enabling the company to focus on areas that yield high returns.
